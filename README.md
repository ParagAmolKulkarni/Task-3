### Evaluation Metrics
```text
Accuracy: 0.84
Confusion Matrix:
[[14  2]
 [ 3 13]]
Precision: 0.8667
Recall: 0.8125
```

## 📈 Key Performance Indicators
- **84% Accuracy**: Model successfully distinguishes real/fake images
- **High Precision**: 86.67% of positive predictions are correct
- **Good Recall**: Captures 81.25% of all positive instances

## 🔧 Limitations
- Current image resolution (32x32) limits detail
- Blurriness in generated images
- Abstract representation of complex shapes
- Limited vocabulary in text processing
- Very time comsuming process

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Implement higher resolution GAN architecture
- Add attention mechanisms
- Use pretrained text embeddings (BERT/GloVe)
- Incorporate progressive growing techniques
- Implement WGAN-GP for training stability
